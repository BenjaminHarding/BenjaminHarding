# Kia ora! 

I'm a front-end developer who loves working on products that users, performance, and useability front of mind. Day-to-day I work as a front-end developer at Canva. 

In the past, I've been a Team Lead at [Raygun](https://raygun.com/) and also taught web development at [Yoobee](https://www.yoobee.ac.nz/), where I also studied.
