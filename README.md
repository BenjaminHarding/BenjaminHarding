# Kia ora! 

I'm a front-end developer and I love working on products that have their users, performance, and useability front of mind. 

I work as a Team Lead at a lovely company called Raygun where we create software solutions that improve the quality and performance of your applications. 

In the past, I taught web development at Yoobee School of Design where I studied Web Development and Interactive Design.  

Mā te wā!
